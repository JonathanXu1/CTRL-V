# Ctrl-V @ UOttaHack

This repository is the code behind our hack submission for UOttaHack 2018. Feel free to use this for educational or non-commercial purposes.

The hack uses an Arduino to control servos and an ultrasonic sensor to determine the precise measurements of an object at a specific position. The data is sent via PySerial to a laptop, which calculates the x y z coordinates. This is then uploaded to Firebase and rendered in 3Js, hosted on AWS.
We really enjoyed making this hack, and believe that this has great potential to virtualize, copy and share objects, all for the price of less than $15.
This hack won best use of AWS and Best Hack award at UOttaHack 2018.
